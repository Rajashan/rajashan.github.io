Step 1: Physics based simulation env (very simple in pygame)
Step 2: Diff drive robot avoiding obstacles
Step 3: Slam and PID 
Step 4 SUBSUMPTION
Step 5 SWARM

# Introduction

The subsumption architecture is a behaviour-based architecture for autonomous robots. Developed by Rodney Brooks at MIT in the 80's, it gained a lot of popularity for allowing robust control of robots, expected to act autonomously in complex environments. 

The main idea is to allow the coupling of sensory information, directly to actuators and thereby action in the real world. With symbolic ai as the overarching backdrop, this architecture served as a radical departure. Received knowledge at the time would suggest that more sophisticated behaviour necessitated more complicated representation and processing. 

I am no expert in robotics. I studied applied mathematics just when the deep learning craze was reaching crescendo (Right before LLM's arrived and subsumed all other machine learning)
