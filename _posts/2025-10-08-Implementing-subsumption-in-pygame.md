# Introduction

The subsumption architecture is a behaviour-based architecture for autonomous robots. Developed by Rodney Brooks at MIT in the 80's, it gained popularity for allowing robust control of robots, expected to act autonomously in complex environments. 

The main idea is to allow the coupling of sensory information, directly to actuators and thereby action in the real world. With symbolic ai as the overarching backdrop, this architecture served as a radical departure. Received wisdom at the time would suggest that more sophisticated behaviour necessitated more complicated representation and processing.

I am no expert in robotics. I studied applied mathematics just when the deep learning craze was reaching crescendo (Right before LLM's arrived and subsumed all other machine learning). I was impressed by the contextual understanding that deep learning and distributed representations brought to the table. This made me abandon my specialization in mathematical biology and transition towards deep learning and NLP. Probably a good choice at the time, career-wise, but something soon became apparent. The problems we were solving were so abstracted as to be empty and when stripped down, were not very inspiring at all. 



# Subsumption

Imagine the canonical image of information processing in a robot or another kind of ai-system. Information from the world comes in, be that pixels, words or some other kind of stimulus that can be digitalized. This is then processed by the internals of the system, leading to some action. This processing could be done by symbolic algorithms or something like neural networks, but what is important is that the system decides centrally what to do next. What was discovered when attempting to build robots to act in the real world, was that the real world is complicated.
